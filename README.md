# [Project 1: Cloud-Computing.](https://github.com/ramrams18/Cloud_Computing) 

Created Web apps on range calculation, cache time detection, radius finding, data distribution charts, adding and searching content, and course registration with three different logins such as teacher, student, and admin. Flask was used to create and host web apps. Executed DB queries and set up a load balancer to distribute inbound traffic.

In this project, I deployed on the web using three cloud platforms: 

* IBM Cloud.

* Microsoft Azure.

* Amazon AWS.

# [Project 2: AmazonShopping Web App.](https://github.com/ramrams18/AmazonShopping-Web-App)

I Developed a demo web application for customers where they can buy products and offer services.

Implemented frontend using HTML and CSS.

# [Project 3: Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks (Colorization).](https://github.com/ramrams18/Image-to-Image-Translation-with-Conditional-Adversarial-Networks-Colorization)

A general purpose solution to Image-to-image translation problems

In the project, i took black and white images and converting them into color images.

Networks learn the mapping from input channel (L) to output channels (ab) and try to generate images using latent space that can fool the discriminator.

Here i used a CNN Generator and CNN Discriminator to achieve results.

# [Project 4: Image Captioning with Conditioned LSTM Generators on flickr8k Data.](https://github.com/ramrams18/Image-Captioning-with-Conditioned-LSTM-Generators)

* Pytorch Implementation

Results:

* Training is done in the notebook as well as inference towards the end

* I have created multiple models which are tested in different epochs and their varrying performence

* To change the model encoder and decoder simply load the appropriate decoder-num_epoch.pkl file

* Lot more traingin is required to get accurate predictions like more then 3 epochs 
  the predictions as of right now are somewhat accurate

* Epoch [3/3], Loss: 2.2159, Perplexity: 9.1694 --> so requires more training with different hyper parameters

# [Project 5: Artificial Intelligence Projects.](https://github.com/ramrams18/Artificial-Intelligence)

A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success, Goals can be explicitly defined or induced.

AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.

Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms.

Projects I worked on.

1] Uninformed and Informed Search.

2] Game Playing.

3] Posterior Probability.

4] Bayesian-Network.

# [Project 6: Implementation of KNN Algorithm on USPS Dataset.](https://github.com/ramrams18/Handwritten-digits-USPS-dataset)

Reading Handwritten Data in Python (JupyterNotebook)

Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras and TensorFlow.

USPS dataset that achieved over 90% accuracy over the test set using K -Neighbors classifier.
