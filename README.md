# [Project 1: Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks (Colorization).](https://github.com/ramrams18/Image-to-Image-Translation-with-Conditional-Adversarial-Networks-Colorization)

A general purpose solution to Image-to-image translation problems

In our project we are taking black and white images and converting them into color images.

Networks learn the mapping from input channel (L) to output channels (ab) and try to           generate images using latent space that can fool the discriminator.

We are using a CNN Generator and CNN Discriminator to achieve our results.

# [Project 2: Image Captioning with Conditioned LSTM Generators on flickr8k Data.](https://github.com/ramrams18/Image-Captioning-with-Conditioned-LSTM-Generators)

* Pytorch Implementation

Results:

* Training is done in the notebook as well as inference towards the end

* I have created multiple models which are tested in different epochs and their varrying performence

* To change the model encoder and decoder simply load the appropriate decoder-num_epoch.pkl file

* Lot more traingin is required to get accurate predictions like more then 3 epochs 
  the predictions as of right now are somewhat accurate

* Epoch [3/3], Loss: 2.2159, Perplexity: 9.1694 --> so requires more training with different hyper parameters

# [Project 3: Artificial Intelligence Projects.](https://github.com/ramrams18/Artificial-Intelligence)

Computer science defines AI research as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success, Goals can be explicitly defined or induced.

AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.

Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms.
