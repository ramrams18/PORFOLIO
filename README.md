# PROJECT EXPERIENCE

## [WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT](https://github.com/ramrams18/Web-Application-Development/tree/main/Course%20Projects)

* Developed a web application for an organization serving 500 customers and business use cases.

* Implemented frontend using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MYSQL as the backend to connect to the
database and used PHP for server-side programming.


## [CLOUD COMPUTING](https://github.com/ramrams18/Cloud_Computing) 

* Azure Cloud and Large Dataset Computation: Implemented K-means Clustering in Python on titanic
dataset and deployed on Azure Cloud.

* Improved the data access speed by 25% using Azure Redis Cache.

* Built various web apps using Python Flask and deployed on IBM Cloud, Azure Cloud, and AWS Cloud.


## [MACHINE LEARNING: IMAGE COLORIZATION USING GAN](https://github.com/ramrams18/Image-to-Image-Translation-with-Conditional-Adversarial-Networks-Colorization)

* Designed and model consisting of multiple CNN to generate color version of black and white images.

* Networks learn the mapping from input channel (L) to output channels (ab) and try to generate images using latent space that can fool the discriminator.

Here i used a CNN Generator and CNN Discriminator to achieve results.

## [MACHINE LEARNING: IMAGE CAPTIONING](https://github.com/ramrams18/Image-Captioning-with-Conditioned-LSTM-Generators)

* Designed and model consisting of CNN and RNN to generate text-based description of images.

* Pytorch Implementation.

Results:

* Training is done in the notebook as well as inference towards the end.

* I have created multiple models which are tested in different epochs and their varrying performence.

* To change the model encoder and decoder simply load the appropriate decoder-num_epoch.pkl file.

* Lot more traingin is required to get accurate predictions like more then 3 epochs 
  the predictions as of right now are somewhat accurate.

* Epoch [3/3], Loss: 2.2159, Perplexity: 9.1694 --> so requires more training with different hyper parameters.


## [ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE](https://github.com/ramrams18/Artificial-Intelligence)

* A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success, Goals can be explicitly defined or induced.

* AI often revolves around the use of algorithms. An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute.

* Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics (strategies that have worked well in the past), or can themselves write other algorithms.

Projects I worked on.

* Uninformed and Informed Search.
* Game Playing.
* Posterior Probability.
* Bayesian-Network.


## [IMPLEMENTAION OF KNN ALGORITHM ON USPS DATASET.](https://github.com/ramrams18/Handwritten-digits-USPS-dataset)

* Reading Handwritten Data in Python (JupyterNotebook).

* Machine Learning with Scikit Learn, Keras and TensorFlow.

* USPS dataset that achieved over 90% accuracy over the test set using K -Neighbors classifier.
